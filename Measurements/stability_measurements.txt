Answers to 2.3:

Comment on these results in one or two sentences: what do you learn of the different methods’ stability? 
- When the numerical method takes care of high orders of taylor expansion the stability increases. Thats why symplectic midpoint and backwards work better.

What, in your opinion, is the correlation between stability and accuracy? 
- In this case there is a trade of between stability and accuracy. Euler has best accuracy and worst stability. 
Midpoint must be inbetween. For the symplectic you can apply same reasoning.

Repeat the experiment with a damping coefficient of 0.5: do the results change your conclusions significantly? 
- Euler becomes more stable and might be prefered in this case over other method since it has better accuracy for step sizes <0.032
 otherwise its bettet to go with the differnet methods
